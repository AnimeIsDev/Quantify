# Quantify
So here is the deal, this retard https://cracked.io/GodkillWasTaken bought a project, then sent me src.  So here I am leaking it!

So as we all know https://cracked.io/Sergent AKA https://cracked.io/BenjiGold AKA https://cracked.io/2Clock is a known exit scammer (yes he is very poor IK) and he is the same guy who built Quantify!

So here we are today leaking the source and going to find anything he may have skidded

Skid #1: Stole SliceAIO Threading System by Ev3res & Xijo: https://uploadi.ng/wZlyHzdb
Skid #2: Also is using the extremely old leaked YoBoi API https://uploadi.ng/CEX3h0LE
Skid #3: Having the exact same classes in multiple modules for literally 0 reason (you did this in all ur other shitty kekrs too bro, learn how to code)

There is probably more things that I just CBA to do enough research on so now lets move onto leaking the shitty src.

FYI: ApePal is going to be coded by https://cracked.io/Sergent AKA https://cracked.io/BenjiGold AKA https://cracked.io/2Clock so I would not trust any more updates from ApePal considering the dev is known to exit scam and ratting people.
